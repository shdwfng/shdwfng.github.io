	<h1>About me</h1>

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Dancing</h3>
			<p>I can't talk about my hobbies without mentioning Ballroom dancing. I've been dancing for four years now, and don't intend to stop any time soon. The University of Michigan's Balroom Dance Team (UMBDT) has been the best part of college for me so far by a lot, and ignited a passion that I didn't even know existed.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Traveling</h3>
			<p>I love traveling whenever I get the chance! While my opportunities are limited due to cost and time constraints, some of my recent favorite trips include Boston, MA and Painted Rocks in the Upper Penninsula of Michigan.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Video Games</h3>
			<p>While I certainly don't have as much time as I used to for games, I do like to pick up whatever sounds interesting when I get the chance. Recently I've been (slowly) getting through Hollow Knight (and remembering how much I like platformers) and the occasional game of League of Legends.</p>
		</li>
