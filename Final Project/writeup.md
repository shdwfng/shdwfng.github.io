## Suggestions
1.	Choose text that contrasts better with the background it’s on. Right now there are several locations where the text doesn’t contrast well with its background, which will make it hard to read for people with certain color impairments.
2.	Write better alt text for the images. Right now most of the alt text is simply the same as the title of the area it’s in, which means that people using screen readers won’t actually know what many of the images are. From the perspective of someone using a screen reader, the images are redundant, so they might as well not even be there. 
3.	Some of the foreground and background colors don’t have a large contrast other than with hue. Providing more contrast in the colors with things like saturation and brightness will make them more distinguishable for people with certain color impairments
